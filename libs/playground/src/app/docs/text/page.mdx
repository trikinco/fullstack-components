# Text

Rewrite, simplify or create text. Handles plain text, markdown and HTML.

```jsx
import { handleTextRequest } from '@trikinco/fullstack-components'
import { getText } from '@trikinco/fullstack-components'
import { Text } from '@trikinco/fullstack-components'
import { useText } from '@trikinco/fullstack-components/client'
```

## `Text` Server Component

### Rewriting text

<Example>
<Text
  prompt="Shorten and simplify"
  grade={5}
  type="HTML"
  as="div"
  className="prose dark:prose-invert"
>
  <h2>Quantum formalism and the uncertainty principle</h2>
  <p>
    One consequence of the basic quantum formalism is the
    uncertainty principle. In its most familiar form, this states
    that no preparation of a quantum particle can imply
    simultaneously precise predictions both for a measurement of its
    position and for a measurement of its momentum.
  </p>

  <p>
  Both position and momentum are observables, meaning that they are represented
  by Hermitian operators. The position operator X and momentum operator P do not
  commute, but rather satisfy the canonical commutation relation.
  </p>
</Text>
</Example>

```jsx title="Text rewrite example"
<Text
  prompt="Shorten and simplify"
  grade={5}
  type="HTML"
  as="div"
  className="prose dark:prose-invert"

```

### Creating text

<Example>
  <Text
    prompt="Make this a longer poem that rhymes"
    type="text"
    as="div"
    className="prose dark:prose-invert"
  >
    happy lizard
  </Text>
</Example>

```jsx title="Text creation example"
<Text
  prompt="Write a poem"
  grade={5}
  type="HTML"
  as="div"
  className="prose dark:prose-invert"
>
  happy lizard
</Text>
```

## `useText` hook

```jsx
'use client'

import { useText } from '@trikinco/fullstack-components/client'

export default function Page() {
  const { isLoading, data } = useText({
    prompt:
      'Simplify and shorten this text, only return plain text',
    grade: 5,
    max: 250,
    content: `
        One consequence of the basic quantum formalism is the uncertainty principle.
        In its most familiar form, this states that no preparation of a quantum
        particle can imply simultaneously precise predictions both for a measurement
        of its position and for a measurement of its momentum.
        `,
  })

  if (isLoading) {
    return 'Loading text...'
  }

  // The content can also be rendered with next-mdx-remote or similar
  return <div className="mt-6">{data?.content}</div>
}
```

`useText` also accepts a tree of components in `content`. Note that only static HTML is returned.

```jsx title="useText with HTML"
const { isLoading, data } = useText({
  prompt: 'Simplify and shorten this text',
  content: (
    <>
      <h3>Quantum formalism and the uncertainty principle</h3>
      <p>
        One consequence of the basic quantum formalism is the
        uncertainty principle. In its most familiar form, this
        states that no preparation of a quantum particle can imply
        simultaneously precise predictions both for a measurement
        of its position and for a measurement of its momentum.
      </p>
    </>
  ),
})
```

## `getText` utility

`getText` is a built-in fetcher with all the same options as `useText`, but it works on the server. Handy for making your own custom Server Components.

```jsx title="Server Component"
import { getText } from '@trikinco/fullstack-components'

export default async function Page() {
  const response = await getText({
    tone: 'Ominous',
    content: 'Welcome to fullstack components',
    type: 'text',
  })

  // The content can also be rendered with next-mdx-remote or similar
  return <div className="mt-6">{response?.content}</div>
}
```

## Setup

Add `text: handleTextRequest()` to the [API handler route](/docs/get-started/#setup).

```ts title="app/api/fsutils/[...fscomponents]/route.ts"
import {
  handleFSComponents,
  handleTextRequest,
  type FSCOptions,
} from '@trikinco/fullstack-components'

const fscOptions: FSCOptions = {
  text: handleTextRequest({
    openAiApiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY || '',
  }),
  // Additional options and handlers...
}

const fscHandler = handleFSComponents(fscOptions)

export { fscHandler as GET, fscHandler as POST }
```
