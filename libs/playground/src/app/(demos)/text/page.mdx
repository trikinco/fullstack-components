### Quantum formalism and the uncertainty principle

One consequence of the basic quantum formalism is the uncertainty principle.
In its most familiar form, this states that no preparation of a quantum
particle can imply simultaneously precise predictions both for a measurement
of its position and for a measurement of its momentum.

Both position and momentum are observables, meaning that they are represented
by Hermitian operators. The position operator X and momentum operator P do not
commute, but rather satisfy the canonical commutation relation.
