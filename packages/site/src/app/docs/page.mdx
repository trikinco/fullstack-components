# Documentation

`fullstack-components` is a library of AI-powered building blocks that make it easy to build smarter Next.js applications from end-to-end.

## Overview

`fullstack-components` lets you **work securely with AI** in these ways:

- **Server and Client Components** to get you up and running in no-time.
- **Functions** to help you performantly fetch data [on the server](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/patterns#fetching-data-on-the-server) and [on the client](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers).
- **Hooks and utilities** that bridge the gaps between components and functions.

This lets you **easily build custom components and functionality**, or use pre-built ones with all the features you need.
