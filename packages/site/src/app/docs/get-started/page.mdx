# Get started with Fullstack Components

Start using [AI-powered building blocks](/docs) to create your next great idea from end-to-end.

## Installation

```sh
npm install @trikinco/fullstack-components
```

## Requirements

- `next>=13`, supporting both App and Pages Routers.
- Your own [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview).

## Setup

If you're using Next.js 13 you must [enable server actions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/serverActions#enabling-server-actions-v13) in your `next.config.js` file. You must remove this if you later upgrade to Next.js 14 or higher.

### Step 1: Add environment variables

These [environment variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables) are **required** to use the OpenAI API and to let you call your own internal Next.js [API route handler](#step-3-configure-the-api-route-handler).

```sh title=".env.local"
OPENAI_API_KEY=<key>
NEXT_PUBLIC_HOST=<url>
```

1. **Replace `<key>`** with your [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview)
1. **Replace `<url>`** with the full URL of your project. e.g `http://localhost:3000` for local development and `https://example.com` for production

### Step 2: Add the API route handler

A new [catch-all dynamic route](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes#catch-all-segments) with an API [route handler](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers) in your Next.js app will handle all the endpoints needed by `fullstack-components`.

These endpoints are needed for all [client-side functionality](/docs/concepts#getters-vs-fetchers) to serve data to components, hooks and other utilities.

#### Adding the route handler file

Depending on which router you use in Next.js, the location of the new API route handler will differ:

- **App Router**: `app/api/fsutils/[...fscomponents]/route.ts`
- **Pages Router**: `pages/api/fsutils/[...fscomponents].ts`

E.g when using the App Router, add the `fsutils/[...fscomponents]` folders to `app/api`, and a new `route.ts` file to the `[...fscomponents]` folder.

### Step 3: Configure the API route handler

As an example, let's set up the API route handler for the `<Image>` component by adding `image: handleImageRequest()`.

```ts title="app/api/fsutils/[...fscomponents]/route.ts"
import {
  handleFSComponents,
  handleImageRequest,
} from '@trikinco/fullstack-components'

const fscHandler = handleFSComponents({
  // Configure one or more handlers
  image: handleImageRequest({
    openAiApiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY || '',
  }),
  // ...Add more handlers here
})

export { fscHandler as GET, fscHandler as POST }
```

_All requests to `/api/fsutils/*`(image, prompt, notFoundEnhancer, etc.) will automatically be handled by `fullstack-components`, as long as you've added the appropriate handler._

Now that you've added the image handler you'll be able to call `/api/fsutils/image` from Client Components, hooks and [`fetchers`](/docs/concepts#fetchers-client).

For using Server Components and [`getters`](/docs/concepts#getters-server) API route handlers are not necessary.

#### Note on API route handlers

All handlers can be imported from `@trikinco/fullstack-components` and are prefixed with `handle`.

**Handlers examples:**

- image: **handleImageRequest**
- htmlPage: **handleHtmlPageRequest**
- notFoundEnhancer: **handleNotFoundEnhancement**

View the documentation for each feature for more details about each handler.
