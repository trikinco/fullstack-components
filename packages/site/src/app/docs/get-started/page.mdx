# Get started with Fullstack Components

`@trikinco/fullstack-components` is a library of React components, hooks and utilities that make it easy to build Next.js applications powered by AI.

## Installation

```sh
npm install @trikinco/fullstack-components
```

## Requirements

- `next>=13` (both App and Pages Routers are supported)
- Your own [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview)

## Setup

If you're using Next.js 13 you must [enable server actions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/serverActions#enabling-server-actions-v13) in your `next.config.js` file. You must remove this if you later upgrade to Next.js 14 or higher.

### Step 1: Add environment variables

```sh title=".env.local"
OPENAI_API_KEY=<key>
NEXT_PUBLIC_HOST=<url>
```

_Read more about adding [environment variables](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables) to your project._

- Replace `<key>` with your [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview)
- Replace `<url>` with the full root URL of your project. e.g `http://localhost:3000` for local development and `https://example.com` for production

### Step 2: Add the API handler route

Create a new [dynamic route](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/dynamic-routes) with an API handler route in your Next.js app. The file will handle all the API endpoints needed by `fullstack-components` to serve data to components, hooks and other utilities.

Depending on which router you use in Next.js, the location of the API handler route will differ:

- Using the Next.js **App Router**: `app/api/fsutils/[...fscomponents]/route.ts`
- Using the Next.js **Pages Router**: `pages/api/fsutils/[...fscomponents].ts`

### Step 3: Configure the API handler route

As an example, let's set up the API handler for the `Image` component by adding `image: handleImageRequest()`.

```ts title="app/api/fsutils/[...fscomponents]/route.ts"
import {
  handleFSComponents,
  handleImageRequest,
} from '@trikinco/fullstack-components'

const fscHandler = handleFSComponents({
  // Configure one or more handlers
  image: handleImageRequest({
    openAiApiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY || '',
  }),
  // ...Add more handlers here
})

export { fscHandler as GET, fscHandler as POST }
```

_All requests to `/api/fsutils/*`(image, prompt, notFoundEnhancer, etc.) will automatically be handled by `fullstack-components`, as long as you've added the appropriate handler._

All handlers can be imported from `@trikinco/fullstack-components` and are prefixed with `handle`.

**Handlers examples:**

- image: **handleImageRequest**
- htmlPage: **handleHtmlPageRequest**
- notFoundEnhancer: **handleNotFoundEnhancement**
