# Usage

Learn the basics of working with `fullstack-components`.

## Styling

Fullstack Components uses [Tailwind](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwindcss) as the default styling engine, but it's an optional dependency. This allows you to use whatever styling approach you prefer.

### Customizing styles with Tailwind

When using Tailwind to customize component styles, it's recommended to use the `merge` utility to safely combine CSS classes without style conflicts.

```tsx
import { merge } from '@trikinco/fullstack-components/utils'
```

`merge` combines [`tailwind-merge`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwind-merge) and [`clsx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx) to allow for efficient and flexible overrides.

```tsx {9-12} title="merge example"
import { Select } from '@trikinco/fullstack-components'
import { merge } from '@trikinco/fullstack-components/utils'

export default async function Page() {
  return (
    <Select
      prompt="The Fellowship Of The Ring"
      context="Playable character for a LOTR game"
      className={merge(
        'bg-blue-800 dark:bg-blue-300',
        'dark:text-black border-none rounded-xl'
      )}
    />
  )
}
```

## Quickstart

After [installing](/docs/get-started#installation), this page takes you through making a **`<NotFoundEnhancer>` Component** that uses your sitemap to find the closest matching page to the "not found" / `404` URL.

The component also uses the contents of your website URLs to create helpful messages for visitors.

### Step 1: Generate a sitemap

You need a sitemap that the `<NotFoundEnhancer>` can scan in order to suggest alternative pages to navigate to.

#### Add a static `sitemap.xml` or generate it dynamically

In Next.js 14, you can [generate a `sitemap.xml`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/metadata/sitemap) in a few different ways. For this simple scenario, consider placing a static file in the app directory or using a `sitemap.(js|ts)` file for dynamic generation.

Alternatively, consider using the [`next-sitemap`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-sitemap) NPM package for easy sitemap creation.

Example output:

```xml title="public/sitemap.xml"
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">
  <url>
    <loc>http://localhost:3000</loc>
    <lastmod>2023-12-25T16:21:41.757Z</lastmod>
    <changefreq>monthly</changefreq>
    <priority>1.0</priority>
  </url>
  <url>
    <loc>http://localhost:3000/about-me</loc>
    <lastmod>2023-12-25T16:21:41.757Z</lastmod>
    <changefreq>weekly</changefreq>
    <priority>0.7</priority>
  </url>
</urlset>
```

Ensure your sitemap is accessible at `/sitemap.xml` in your application, and continue to the next step.

### Step 2: Configure the API route handler

In the [API route handler](/docs/get-started#step-2-add-the-api-route-handler), add the following configuration to use the `useNotFoundEnhancement` hook shown later.

```ts {16} title="app/api/fsutils/[...fscomponents]/route.ts"
import {
  handleFSComponents,
  handleNotFoundEnhancement,
  type FSCOptions,
} from '@trikinco/fullstack-components'

const fscOptions: FSCOptions = {
  notFoundEnhancer: handleNotFoundEnhancement({
    openAiApiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY || '',
    /**
     * Required.
     * Full URL of your project.
     * @example local development 'http://localhost:3000'
     * @example production 'https://example.com'
     */
    siteUrl: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_HOST || '',
  }),
  // Additional options and handlers...
}

const fscHandler = handleFSComponents(fscOptions)

export { fscHandler as GET, fscHandler as POST }
```

Remember to [add `NEXT_PUBLIC_HOST` to your `.env`](/docs/get-started#step-1-add-environment-variables) file, or inline in `handleNotFoundEnhancement`.

**Not Found Enhancer requires configuration of the API handler route.** Not all features require configuration, so read the documentation for each feature.

### Step 3: Create the Client Component

The core part of the functionality is using the `useNotFoundEnhancement` hook to get the data you'll need.

```tsx {3,7,18,26-30} title="components/NotFoundEnhancer.tsx"
'use client'

import { useNotFoundEnhancement } from '@trikinco/fullstack-components/client'
import Link from 'next/link'

export function NotFoundEnhancer() {
  const { data, isLoading } = useNotFoundEnhancement()
  const hasUrlSuggestions =
    data?.bestAlternateUrls && data.bestAlternateUrls.length > 0

  if (!data || isLoading) {
    return <p>Please wait, checking for other solutions...</p>
  }

  return (
    <div className="mt-6">
      {/* A helpful message derived from inspecting the `requestedUrl` and sitemap. */}
      <p>{data?.generatedContent}</p>

      {hasUrlSuggestions && (
        <>
          <p className="font-bold">
            Try one of these pages instead:
          </p>
          {/* A list of the most likely suitable URLs for the visitor to navigate to. */}
          {data?.bestAlternateUrls.map((url, i) => (
            <Link href={url} key={i} className="block">
              {url}
            </Link>
          ))}
        </>
      )}

      {!hasUrlSuggestions && (
        <p>
          Sorry we couldn't find additional pages for you to try
          this time.
        </p>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Step 4: Create a `not-found` page

- Using the Next.js App Router: Create a [`not-found.tsx` page](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/not-found) in your app.
- Using the Next.js Pages Router: [Create a `404.tsx` page](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-error#404-page) in your app.

```tsx {2,10} title="pages/404.tsx or app/not-found.tsx"
import Link from 'next/link'
import { NotFoundEnhancer } from '@/components/NotFoundEnhancer'

export default function NotFoundPage() {
  return (
    <main>
      <h1>Not Found</h1>
      <p>Could not find requested resource</p>
      <Link href="/">Return Home</Link>
      <NotFoundEnhancer />
    </main>
  )
}
```

Now that you've created the `not-found` page and added the `<NotFoundEnhancer>`, try visiting a URL in your application that doesn't exist to see it in action.

### Testing it out

For example, navigate to [http://localhost:3000/about-123](http://localhost:3000/about-123), or any other URL that doesn't exist in your application.

If everything works correctly you'll notice how the `<NotFoundEnhancer>` dynamically enhances your application's 'Not Found' page.

### Keep in mind

The more pages your Next.js application has in its sitemap, the more effectively the `<NotFoundEnhancer>` works, providing a richer user experience.
