# Concepts

Learn some of the core concepts of `fullstack-components`.

## Getters vs fetchers

All library functionality include one or more **getters** and **fetchers**, as prefixed by `get` and `fetch` respectively.
The difference between the two is where they can be used, and where the third-party API request is made.

In short:

- **getters can only be used on the _server_.**
- **fetchers can only be used on the _client_.**

### Getters: Server

Getters are [Server Actions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations) that call the third-party API [directly on the server](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/patterns#fetching-data-on-the-server). This avoids calling the Next.js [API route handler](/docs/get-started/#setup) and reduces the back-and-forth communication between client and server.

Use getters to make [Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) and other server functionality.

- `'use server'`
- Third-party API requests only
- Imported from the library root

```ts title="Getter import example"
import { getPrompt } from '@trikinco/fullstack-components'
```

### Fetchers: Client

Fetchers are asynchronous functions that call the internal Next.js [API route handler](/docs/get-started/#setup), then the third-party API.

Use fetchers to make [Client Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components) and other browser functionality.

- `'use client'`
- Internal Next.js API request, then third-party API requests
- Imported from the `/client` directory

```ts /client/ title="Fetcher import example"
import { fetchPrompt } from '@trikinco/fullstack-components/client'
```
